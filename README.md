# ALX Software Engineering Program - Week [5]: CSS Advanced Project

## Overview
This week’s project in the ALX Software Engineering Program focuses on advancing your understanding and application of **CSS** to style a webpage based on a provided Figma design. The project builds on the **HTML, advanced** project, emphasizing clean, efficient, and accurate CSS styling without the use of external libraries. By the end of this project, you will have a deeper understanding of CSS concepts and the ability to create a visually appealing, W3C-compliant webpage.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without external references:
- **What is CSS**: Understand the role of Cascading Style Sheets in web development.
- **How to add style to an element**: Apply styles using inline, internal, or external CSS.
- **What is a class**: Define and use CSS classes to style multiple elements.
- **What is a selector**: Use different types of CSS selectors (e.g., element, class, ID) to target HTML elements.
- **How to compute CSS Specificity Value**: Calculate specificity to resolve style conflicts.
- **What are Box properties in CSS**: Understand and apply box model properties (e.g., margin, padding, border, width, height).
- **How does the browser load a webpage**: Explain the process of how browsers render HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Requirements
- All files must end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file is mandatory at the root of the project folder.
- No external libraries (e.g., NodeJS, React, VueJS, Bootstrap) are allowed—use only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
- Code must be **W3C compliant** and validate using the [W3C-Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
- Use the provided Figma design for styling references, including colors, widths, heights, and images.
- Fonts used in the design (Source Sans Pro and Spin Cycle OT) are available for download if not already installed.
- Round any float values from the Figma design as needed.

## Resources
- **Figma Design**: Access the design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/dyYL6Ku4WG7vsdpwvlcJZC/Homepage) and “Duplicate to your Drafts” for detailed specifications.
- **Images**: Download required images [here](https://savanna.alxafrica.com/rltoken/sGbjBBQFlXg61KqQaWzurA).
- **Fonts**: Source Sans Pro and Spin Cycle OT are available [here](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-sans-pro).

## Tasks
This project consists of the following tasks, each focusing on styling specific sections of the webpage based on the Figma design:

### 0. README and Objectives

- Create an `index.html` file based on the HTML code from the **HTML, advanced** project, making necessary adjustments (e.g., adding image paths for logos).
- **Files**: `README.md`, `index.html`
- **Repository**: `alx_html_css`, Directory: `css_advanced`

### 1. Import the Style
- Create a `styles.css` file.
- Link `styles.css` in the `<head>` of `index.html`.
- **Files**: `index.html`, `styles.css`
- **Repository**: `alx_html_css`, Directory: `css_advanced`

### 2. Header and Banner
- Style the header and first section of the webpage according to the Figma design.
- Ensure accurate use of colors, dimensions, and images.
- Keep CSS selectors simple and clean.
- **File**: `styles.css`
- **Repository**: `alx_html_css`, Directory: `css_advanced`

### 3. Quotes

- **Repository**: `alx_html_css`, Directory: `css_advanced`

### 4. Videos List
- Style the videos list section as per the Figma design.

## Guidelines
- Focus on creating **simple and clean CSS selectors** to maintain readability and efficiency.
- Ensure the final webpage closely matches the Figma design in terms of layout, colors, and spacing.
- Validate all code using the W3C-Validator to ensure compliance.
- Centralize common styles where possible to avoid redundancy.
- Use the provided images and fonts to achieve the desired visual outcome.

## Repository
- **GitHub Repository**: `alx_html_css`
- **Directory**: `css_advanced`
- **Files**:
  - `README.md`
  - `index.html`
  - `styles.css`

## Notes
- Refer to the Figma design for precise measurements and styling details.
- If fonts are unavailable, download them from the provided links.
- Round float values from Figma as needed for simplicity.
- No external libraries are permitted; focus on vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project will enhance your CSS skills and prepare you for building professional, visually appealing webpages. Happy coding!
